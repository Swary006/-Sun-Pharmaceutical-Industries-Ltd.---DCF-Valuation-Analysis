# üí∞ Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. ‚Äî DCF Valuation Analysis  
**Date:** May 2025  

## üìù Project Overview  
This project presents a **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation** for **Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.**, aimed at estimating its intrinsic value and comparing it to the prevailing market price.  

The model was **entirely built in Microsoft Excel**, incorporating detailed financial projections, free cash flow estimation, WACC computation, terminal value calculation, and scenario-based sensitivity analysis.

## üîç Key Findings  
- **Intrinsic Value (Base Case):** ‚Çπ679 per share  
- **Market Price (at analysis date):** ‚Çπ1,830 per share  
- **Market Premium:** ~62% above intrinsic value  
- **WACC:** 12.21%  
- **Terminal Growth Rate:** 5.90%  
- **Effective Tax Rate:** 15.58%  

üìå The model suggests the market is **pricing in significant optimism** around Sun Pharma‚Äôs specialty drug pipeline, U.S. expansion, and potential M&A ‚Äî factors not fully captured in conservative DCF assumptions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology (Excel Workflow)  
1. **Revenue Forecasting:** Built 5-year revenue projections using historical growth rates and industry trends.  
2. **EBIT & Tax Modeling:** Computed EBIT margins, effective tax rates, and post-tax operating profits (EBIAT).  
3. **Free Cash Flow Calculation:** Derived FCFF from EBIAT by adding back D&A, adjusting for CapEx and changes in working capital.  
4. **WACC Estimation:**  
   - Cost of Equity: 12.32% (using CAPM)  
   - Cost of Debt: 6.49% (post-tax)  
   - Weighted Average: 12.21%  
5. **Terminal Value:** Applied a perpetual growth model with a 5.9% terminal growth rate.  
6. **Sensitivity Analysis:** Tested varying WACC and growth rate assumptions to observe changes in enterprise and equity values.  
7. **Visualization:** Created a **Market vs. Intrinsic Value Waterfall Chart** to communicate valuation gaps.
